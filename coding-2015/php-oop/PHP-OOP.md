## Object Oriented in PHP

- Class = Group of relevant attributes and methods, (blueprint of an object)
- Object = the realization of a class
- Instantiation = a way to realize a class into an object
- Attribute = relevant variable(s) for a class
- Method = relevanat functions(s) for a class
- Constructor & Destructor = special method that are called when a class is instantiate and when a class is destroyed
- Inheritance = a way to extend the functionalities of a class
- Polymorphism = way of creating different behaviour for a class
- Overriding = method that has same name to parent class (only in inheritance)
- Overloadinng = method that has the same name to the other on 
		but different parameters
- Static method / attribute = method or attribute that can be accessed directly
		without instantiating the class 


The main reason of using object orientation in programming:
- Code reusability
- Code managability
- Design pattern

Java OO vs PHP OO:
- we don't have to determine the datatype
  for variable and method return type
- there is no overloading in PHP, but we have
  optional parameter instead
- in Java we use "." (dot) to call method
  or attribute of the object, but in PHP we
  user "->" (arrow) to do the same thing
- same as Java, PHP doesn't have destructor
  method, but still has constructor method
- in Java we create a function with the same
  name as the respective class to be a constructor,
  but in PHP we use "__construct" to make a
  constructor method
